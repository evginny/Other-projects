## Project 1 C++ - Generic Doubly-linked List and Memory Management Simulation
Implemented a generic doubly-linked list class template along with associated iterators.Using the created doubly-linked list, developed a basic memory management simulator. The simulator emulates the creation, allocation, deallocation, and resizing of memory blocks in a simulated operating system environment.  
## Project 2 C++ - Stack and Its Applications
Implemented a generic Stack container using an adaptor class template. Also created two programs: one that converts infix arithmetic expressions to postfix format, and another that evaluates these postfix expressions. Through these tasks, I deepened my understanding of stack data structures and algorithm complexity.
## Project 3 C++ - Binary Tree and Its Application
This project involves creating a Binary Expression Tree (BET) to convert postfix mathematical expressions into infix expressions. The tree handles four basic operators (+, -, *, /) and functions include tree manipulation, expression conversion, and infix printing. Conversion requires building a BET from a postfix expression, then printing it in infix format while maintaining operation order.
## Project 4 C++ - Hash Tables and Its Applications
This project involves creating a HashTable class and a PassServer program. The HashTable class implements operations like insertion, deletion, and searching. The PassServer program, using this HashTable, manages user accounts by storing usernames and encrypted passwords, supports operations like adding and removing users, and changes passwords. It uses the crypt() method for password encryption. This project will enhance understanding of hash tables, password management, and algorithm complexity analysis.
## Project 5 C - Kernel Module Programming
Created this application in Linux using system calls and kernel programming. The scheduler handles customer groups at a bar, accommodating a maximum of 32 customers. I added system calls for bar operations and used a proc entry to display the system's state. I tested it using 'producer.c' and 'consumer.c' applications.
## Project 6 Java - TicTacToe
I created a console-based TicTacToe game with both human and computer players. The game uses a strategic AI for computer moves, with an advanced mode for a stronger AI that employs a more sophisticated strategy ensuring the computer never loses.It provides a user-friendly interface with ASCII-based grid output. Designed for reusability, the game can be adapted for a GUI in the future.
## Project 7 Java - Triangles
I developed a Java application that dynamically draws five colored triangles on a resizable JFrame. Each triangle and its color are randomly generated, adjusting to frame changes and refreshing upon resizing, offering an interactive display.
