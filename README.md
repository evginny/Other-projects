## Project 1 C++ - Generic Doubly-linked List and Memory Management Simulation
1. Doubly-linked List Implementation: Implement a generic doubly-linked list class template along with associated iterators.  
2. Memory Management Simulation: Using the created doubly-linked list, develop a basic memory management simulator. The simulator should emulate the creation, allocation, deallocation, and resizing of memory blocks in a simulated operating system environment.
